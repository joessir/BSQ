# The aim of this project is to find the biggest square on a map, avoiding obstacles.
## A file containing the map will be provided. It’ll have to be passed as an argument for the program.
* The first line of the map contains information on how to read the map :
* The number of lines on the map;
* The "empty" character;
* The "obstacle" character;
* The "full" character.
## The map is made up of ’"empty" characters’, lines and ’"obstacle" characters’.
## The aim of the program is to replace ’"empty" characters’ by ’"full" characters’ in order to represent the biggest square possible.
## In the case that more than one solution exists, we’ll choose to represent the square that’s closest to the top of the map, then the one that’s most to the left.
